= MOTIVATION

ecore is intended to be a mapper of a content repository 
ran through any other adapter, like Active Record of the 
RoRails project or any other adapter. It's up to you which 
one you judge to be useful for you needs.

== Requirenments

ecore needs some kind of database or datastore to call when creating
something.

== Basic usage

ecore queries objects, let's assume an ActiveRecord database model
named "Contact" through the Ecore::Node.find() method. This passes on
the syntax to the actual adapter (adaption of adapter-specific syntax
will be required) and returns a bunch of objects matching the query.
There are two parameters making Ecore::Node.find() differ from, let's say
ActiveRecord::Base.find()

Ecore::Node.find(session, type, query)

The last argument, query, is passed on to ActiveRecord, the session object
will be used to extract the user's id and include it into the query, so only
objects where this very user has privileges on will be found.

Just to be clear, there is no Ecore::Node object as such. Nodes are just any
kind of database tables (or what ever adapter is used) equipped with additional
attributes (columns) like "hashed_acl, name(required!), created_by, updated_by, 
created_at, updated_at, deleted_at, versions"
